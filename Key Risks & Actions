Identify Risks and Actions


Technical Risks

- Because of previous classes, all the students working on this project are familiar with front-end development. Unfortunately, only one student 
has some experience with back-end development. The risk of not creating a successful back-end will decrease by acquiring knowledge on the subject. 
This will be done using video tutorials, articles, and meeting with the teacher's assistants.


Schedule Risks

- Every student on the team has a school and work schedule, which sometimes makes it difficult to set a specific meeting time to discuss the project.
So we can have risks of miscommunication or time management.  Our solution to this problem is to communicate using websites such as Discord, GitHub,
and Trello, which allows us to stay in sync and keep track of any pending tasks or questions anyone has at any time.


Teamwork Risks

- As with any group project, it is common for some individuals to be more engaged than others, which for some members can lead to work overload and
frustration. The solution is to distribute the workload evenly and monitor everyone's progress via Trello. By using Trello, any team member can 
easily check if any tasks are falling behind schedule. This enables them to reach out to the responsible member, ask questions, or offer assistance
to ensure the completion of their tasks. This approach ensures that everyone contributes to the project and fosters a collaborative environment where
team members support one another.
