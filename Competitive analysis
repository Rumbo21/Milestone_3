Competitive analysis:
Since there are few platforms exclusively dedicated to carpooling among college
students, we will compare websites that offer either carpooling services or only students
feature. The competitive analysis will compare five websites focusing on their five main
features: design, security, usability, feedback, and performance. Using a numerical scale
from 1 to 5 where 1 is bad, 2 is poor, 3 is fair, 4 is good, and 5 is excellent.

RideMate ( 4.6 )
RideMate stands out with its user-friendly and straightforward design, ensuring
that features are easily accessible and intuitive for users. The website offers a seamless
and uncomplicated booking process with contrasting colors in its design so users can
have an intuitive and inclusive interface that simplifies the carpooling experience.
RideMate ensures that ride-sharing is limited to students from the same university
implementing user authentication through email, school ID verification, and a third-party
authentication app. This stringent authentication process minimizes safety concerns by
significantly reducing the likelihood of unauthorized individuals gaining access to the
platform. This allows students to connect with peers who are likely to share similar
schedules, locations, and interests, fostering a sense of camaraderie and convenience
within the university community. The website's content is based on ride availability and
ratings. Search and navigation are fast and operate with autocomplete and breadcrumbs
features. By focusing on a specific university or a limited number of universities,
RideMate can optimize its services by identifying popular routes and pickup/drop-off
points.
Uber ( 4.1 ) https://www.uber.com/
Uber has a clean design and navigation, but sometimes some users find the app
overwhelming due to the abundance of features. Despite the implementation of GPS
tracking and in-app emergency assistance, incidents involving drivers have been
reported, highlighting the importance of enhancing safety measures. Uber's performance
and rating system require substantial improvement. The lack of available drivers in
specific locations often leads to prolonged waiting times for customers seeking rides.
Moreover, the rating system is susceptible to manipulation, as there is a lack of control
over unfair ratings that may be influenced by factors unrelated to the ride experience.
These issues highlight the need for more effective measures to ensure a reliable and fair
system for drivers and passengers.
Lyft ( 4.0 ) https://www.lyft.com/
As a direct competitor to Uber, Lyft shares several similarities in its overall
performance and usability. Just like Uber, Lyft faces challenges in terms of security
measures, objective ratings, and driver availability based on location. In some instances,
Lyft may have fewer drivers compared to Uber since the latter is more popular. One
characteristic of Lyft is its vibrant design which may be visually appealing to many users.
However, it can sometimes result in a less intuitive user experience.
Zimride ( 3.4 ) https://www.zimride.com/
Although Zimride initially started as a public ride-hailing app, it has transitioned
to mainly offering ride-sharing services to universities and businesses. Despite its shift in
market target, it is not a platform exclusively for students like RideMate. Zimride's
design lacks the advanced features and visual appeal found in more popular ride-sharing
platforms such as Uber or Lyft.
Waze Carpool ( 3.5 ) https://www.waze.com/
Even though Waze Carpool connects users within a community, there is a limited
additional security measure outside the verified profiles by pictures of commuters and
drivers. Despite being fairly known, Waze Carpool's design feels less polished and its
rating system may have fewer entries in comparison to Uber or Lyft. Like its competitors,
Waze Carpool does not specifically target a particular market. Therefore, college students
using this platform for carpooling should take into consideration that it is a public
service, and they will not be riding exclusively with fellow students.
Scoop ( 3.4 ) https://www.scoopforwork.com/
Scoop's greatest disadvantage lies in its limited offering of rides exclusively for
individuals who are meeting at the same time and location. The platform operates by
scheduling rides through the use of polls by determining when people want to meet at the
office. While this system structure enables efficient coordination among riders, it also
restricts the availability of rides, potentially posing challenges for those seeking more
flexible transportation options. Scoop's visual appeal may be lacking, characterized by
dull colors and an outdated design. Additionally, due to its smaller user base, the number
of ratings and reviews on the platform is comparatively lower than on other ride-sharing
platforms. Although Scoop implements certain safety measures such as user verification
and ratings, it offers fewer additional safety features in comparison to Uber and Lyft.
Planned Advantages:
RideMate concentrates on students' safety and convenience, so some of the future features to be implemented 
on this site include but are not exclusive to reservations, university specifications, advance schedule availability, 
special offers, chat, attend events rides, and female-only rides. For now, RideMate is focused on offering a transport
platform for students at Florida Atlantic University, Florida Atlantic Highschool, and Palm Beach State College at Boca Raton. 
We will soon offer the same services to more universities and college campuses. RideMate can tailor its features to meet
the specific needs of university students. For example, it could offer features like in-app communication platforms,
making it easier for students to coordinate rides, join clubs, or attend events. RideMate could collaborate with local
businesses or university organizations to provide exclusive discounts or rewards for using the app. This can improve 
the overall value proposition for students and promote the platform within the university community.
